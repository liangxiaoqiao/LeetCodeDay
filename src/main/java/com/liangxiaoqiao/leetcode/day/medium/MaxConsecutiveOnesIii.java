 * desc: Given an array A of 0s and 1s, we may change up to K values from 0 to 1.\nReturn the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only 1s. \n  Example 1:\nInput: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: \n[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]\nBolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.\nExample 2:\nInput: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3\nOutput: 10\nExplanation: \n[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]\nBolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.\n  Note:\n1 <= A.length <= 20000\n0 <= K <= A.length\nA[i] is 0 or 1
