 * href: https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-words
 * desc: In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other words to form another longer word - let\'s call this word successor. For example, the root an, followed by other, which can form another word another.\nNow, given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence. You need to replace all the successor in the sentence with the root forming it. If a successor has many roots can form it, replace it with the root with the shortest length.\nYou need to output the sentence after the replacement.\nExample 1:\nInput: dict = [\"cat\", \"bat\", \"rat\"]\nsentence = \"the cattle was rattled by the battery\"\nOutput: \"the cat was rat by the bat\"\n  Note:\nThe input will only have lower-case letters.\n1 <= dict words number <= 1000\n1 <= sentence words number <= 1000\n1 <= root length <= 100\n1 <= sentence words length <= 1000\n

 * 描述： 在英语中，我们有一个叫做 词根(root)的概念，它可以跟着其他一些词组成另一个较长的单词——我们称这个词为 继承词(successor)。例如，词根an，跟随着单词 other(其他)，可以形成新的单词 another(另一个)。\n现在，给定一个由许多词根组成的词典和一个句子。你需要将句子中的所有继承词用词根替换掉。如果继承词有许多可以形成它的词根，则用最短的词根替换它。\n你需要输出替换之后的句子。\n示例 1:\n输入: dict(词典) = [\"cat\", \"bat\", \"rat\"]\nsentence(句子) = \"the cattle was rattled by the battery\"\n输出: \"the cat was rat by the bat\"\n注:\n输入只包含小写字母。\n1 <= 字典单词数 <=1000\n1 <=  句中词语数 <= 1000\n1 <= 词根长度 <= 100\n1 <= 句中词语长度 <= 1000
