 * href: https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges
 * desc: In a given grid, each cell can have one of three values:\nthe value 0 representing an empty cell;\nthe value 1 representing a fresh orange;\nthe value 2 representing a rotten orange.\nEvery minute, any fresh orange that is adjacent (4-directionally) to a rotten orange becomes rotten.\nReturn the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange.  If this is impossible, return -1 instead.\n  Example 1:\nInput: [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]\nOutput: 4\nExample 2:\nInput: [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation:  The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.\nExample 3:\nInput: [[0,2]]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation:  Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.\n  Note:\n1 <= grid.length <= 10\n1 <= grid[0].length <= 10\ngrid[i][j] is only 0, 1, or 2.
