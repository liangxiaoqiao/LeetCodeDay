 * href: https://leetcode.com/problems/poor-pigs
 * desc: There are 1000 buckets, one and only one of them is poisonous, while the rest are filled with water. They all look identical. If a pig drinks the poison it will die within 15 minutes. What is the minimum amount of pigs you need to figure out which bucket is poisonous within one hour?\nAnswer this question, and write an algorithm for the general case.\n  General case:\nIf there are n buckets and a pig drinking poison will die within m minutes, how many pigs (x) you need to figure out the poisonous bucket within p minutes? There is exactly one bucket with poison.\n  Note:\nA pig can be allowed to drink simultaneously on as many buckets as one would like, and the feeding takes no time.\nAfter a pig has instantly finished drinking buckets, there has to be a cool down time of m minutes. During this time, only observation is allowed and no feedings at all.\nAny given bucket can be sampled an infinite number of times (by an unlimited number of pigs).

 * 描述： 有 1000 只水桶，其中有且只有一桶装的含有毒药，其余装的都是水。它们从外观看起来都一样。如果小猪喝了毒药，它会在 15 分钟内死去。\n问题来了，如果需要你在一小时内，弄清楚哪只水桶含有毒药，你最少需要多少只猪？\n回答这个问题，并为下列的进阶问题编写一个通用算法。\n  进阶:\n假设有 n 只水桶，猪饮水中毒后会在 m 分钟内死亡，你需要多少猪（x）就能在 p 分钟内找出 “有毒” 水桶？这 n 只水桶里有且仅有一只有毒的桶。\n  提示：\n可以允许小猪同时饮用任意数量的桶中的水，并且该过程不需要时间。\n小猪喝完水后，必须有 m 分钟的冷却时间。在这段时间里，只允许观察，而不允许继续饮水。\n任何给定的桶都可以无限次采样（无限数量的猪）。
