 * desc: Given an array A of non-negative integers, the array is squareful if for every pair of adjacent elements, their sum is a perfect square.\nReturn the number of permutations of A that are squareful.  Two permutations A1 and A2 differ if and only if there is some index i such that A1[i] != A2[i].\n  Example 1:\nInput: [1,17,8]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \n[1,8,17] and [17,8,1] are the valid permutations.\nExample 2:\nInput: [2,2,2]\nOutput: 1\n  Note:\n1 <= A.length <= 12\n0 <= A[i] <= 1e9
